ONE PAGE SOLO ENGINE
Version: 1.6	CC-BY-SA 4.0
A minimal, all-in-one toolkit to play your favorite tabletop RPGs without a GM.

HOW TO PLAY
1	Create one or more characters using your chosen game system.
2	Roll a starting PLOT HOOK and a RANDOM EVENT, then SET THE SCENE.
3	Start asking the ORACLE questions.  Interpret the answers in context.
4	Play the game to overcome the challenges of the scene.
5	Use GM MOVES to move the action.
6	SET THE SCENE for the next thing you want your character to do.

USING PLAYING CARDS
This system uses a deck of playing cards to inspire answers.  Look up the rank in the appropriate table and combine with the SUIT DOMAIN below to determine the answer.  When you draw a Joker, shuffle the deck and add a RANDOM EVENT.

SUIT DOMAIN:
Clubs – Physical (appearance, existence)
Diamonds – Technical (mental, operation)
Spades – Mystical (meaning, capability)
Hearts – Social (personal, connection)


OPTIONAL: USE ONLY CARDS
When you would roll a d6, draw a card and use the rank divided by 2 (round down).  Discard Aces.

OPTIONAL: USE ONLY DICE
When you would draw a card, roll a d12 for the rank and a d4 for the suit.  On a 12, flip a coin to see if you use the Q or K.

SET THE SCENE
Describe where your character is and what they are trying to accomplish, then roll or choose a SCENE COMPLICATION.

SCENE COMPLICATION (D6):
1	Hostile forces oppose you
2	An obstacle blocks your way
3	Wouldn’t it suck if…
4	An NPC acts suddenly
5	All is not as is seems
6	Things actually go as planned

Roll 1d6, on a 5+, it is an ALTERED SCENE.

ALTERED SCENE (D6):
1	A major detail of the scene is enhanced or somehow worse
2	The environment is different
3	Unexpected NPCs are present
4	Add a SCENE COMPLICATION
5	Add a PACING MOVE
6	Add a RANDOM EVENT

ORACLE (YES/NO)
When you need to ask a simple question, choose the likelihood and roll 2d6.

Answer (d6)
Likely	  Yes on 3+
Even	  Yes on 4+
Unlikely  Yes on 5+

Mod (d6)
1	but…
2-5	
6	and…

ORACLE (HOW)

Answer (D6):
1	Surprisingly lacking
2	Less than expected
3-4	About average
5	More than expected
6	Extraordinary

GM MOVES
When you need to advance the action, roll on the tables below and describe the results as the GM normally would.

Use a PACING MOVE when there is a lull in the action, or you think “what now?”  Use a FAILURE MOVE to move things forward when the PCs fail a check.

PACING MOVES (D6):
1	Foreshadow Trouble
2	Reveal a New Detail
3	An NPC Takes Action
4	Advance a Threat
5	Advance a Plot
6	Add a RANDOM EVENT to the scene

FAILURE MOVES (D6):

5	Reveal an Unwelcome Truth
6	Foreshadow Trouble

MORE INFORMATION
One Page Solo Engine was designed to be incredibly concise and minimalistic, but still have all the essential tools required to run a game without a GM.  The first two pages of this document are all that are required to play.  I understand some people might want to know a bit more, though, so here are some notes.

INTENDED AUDIENCE
This is really meant for people who are already familiar with RPGs and playing them solo.  Most of the tools assume you have already encountered similar concepts in other products.  If you’re completely new to solo or GM-less gaming, check out some of the products in the Acknowledgements to get started.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
There are a great many excellent tools out there to run a solo RPG game.  I always found, however, that many of them were overly complicated.  You shouldn’t have to read 15 pages of rules and make 10 dice rolls just to determine what the guards in a room are doing.

Also, many tools only provide part of what you need to actually play.  Some only answer questions, while others only provide narrative structure or generate random elements.  A complete oracle should do all these things. 

One Page Solo Engine was designed to provide every tool needed to run a solo game using any game system while using as few words as humanly possible.

GM MOVES
Though the GM Moves section is highly inspired by PbtA games, the system will work with virtually any tabletop RPG. The reason the PbtA framework was chosen is that it gamifies the role of the GM with discrete moves that can fit in a table.

How you use the GM Moves will depend on the game system you are playing.  If you’re playing a PbtA game, it will be obvious when to use them because PbtA is built around the concept of partial success.  If you aren’t, just use them when you want to move things along.

If you need more information on how to use the individual GM Moves, check out any PbtA game such as Dungeon World, Uncharted Worlds, or many others.

PACING MOVES
Pacing Moves should be used to fill in the gaps during those times when the players would normally look to the GM to see what happens next.  They represent the little prompting and extra details that a GM usually adds.  Try using one whenever you want to move the action forward.

FAILURE MOVES
Failure Moves represent setbacks or partial successes.  Maybe the roll failed, but the character still gets part of what they wanted or all of it with a cost.  These moves keep the action moving during failures and can be used in virtually any RPG system instead of just saying “no that failed”.

NON-PBTA GAMES
When playing a Non-PbtA game, it is important to remember that not every failure should result in a GM Move. 

Sometimes the Spot check just fails because there was nothing there.  GM Moves should be used when a roll fails and there are consequences for failure, or the action needs to pick up.  Checking the room for secret doors?  Probably not.  Climbing a cliff in the rain to escape group of cultists?  Definitely.

THE POWER OF INTERPRETATION
Some solo RPG tools contain dozens of tables with hundreds of entries each.  The problem with these is that they are either thematically tuned to a certain genre of game, or they are so specific the results just don’t make sense.

When using the One Page Solo Engine, remember that the answers are meant to inspire an idea that makes sense in the context of your game.  The answer should have meaning, not just be a random detail.  The result may be surprising, but it should always be logical.

Give all results meaning.  Embrace the unexpected.  Reject the nonsensical.

USING A DECK OF CARDS
Many people who try this system wonder why a deck of cards was chosen for randomization.  The reason is because a playing card carries more information than a die roll and the suits work well for applying a “domain” to the results.

I’ve seen this used to great success in systems like World vs Hero and decided to apply it to a generic solo engine.  Instead of having a huge table with every adjective you can pull from the dictionary, you have a smaller table with more general words and a domain that they can apply to.  This results in more interpretation and less guesswork about how “divinely slippery” could possibly apply to your current situation.

TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
*	Ask mostly yes/no questions
*	Loose interpretations are okay
*	Always go with what’s cool
*	If it doesn’t make sense, try again
*	Use GM Moves to drive the action
*	Try group play with no GM, it’s great

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
One Page Solo Engine was created by taking the things I liked from other solo tools, stripping them down to the bare bones, and then adding in a bit of the process I use for my own games.  It would not be possible without inspiration from:
*	Mythic (Tana Pigeon)
*	World vs Hero (John Fiore)
*	Conjecture, UNE (Zach Best)
*	Dungeon World (Koebel, LaTorra)
*	The Black Hack (David Black)
*	Maze Rats (Ben Milton)
*	The Lone Wolf Solo RPG community
